# Snake-game
The player controls the direction of movement of the snake. Fruits
are present at random points inside the barrier. The goal is to eat
the fruit. When the snake hits the fruit, size of its tail increases.
The score is updated by +10 each time the snake eats the fruit.

The user can play two levels.
In Level 1, the snake can touch the boundary and comes from the
opposite side of the boundary. When you have attained a
particular score, you will enter the next level.

In Level 2, the game is over if the snake touches the barrier.

The implementation is in C++.
